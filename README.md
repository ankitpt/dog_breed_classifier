## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
This is my Capstone Project submission for Udacity Nanodegree. A dog breed image data was made available with 8352 images spread across 133 categories and the goal was to train a classifier for identifying breed of a dog in a given image. 

Following tasks were performed for the project:

- Create and train a CNN from scratch for dog breed classification 
- Use bottleneck features from pre-trained VGG model as input and train a fully connected network
- Use bottleneck features from pre-trained Resnet50 model as input and train a fully-connected network
- Use the network trained with Resnet50 features for testing on new images (not part of original dataset)
